# Image Generation Performance Test

This repository contains a Python script to test the average time it takes to generate images using a serverless endpoint and the DreamShaper lightning model.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (can be installed via `requirements.txt`)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-generation-test.git
    cd image-generation-test
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Update the `test_image_generation.py` script with your serverless endpoint and any necessary headers or payload adjustments.

## Running the Test

To run the test and calculate the average time taken to generate an image, execute:
```bash
python test_image_generation.py
```

## Script Explanation

The script sends 10 POST requests to the specified serverless endpoint to generate images and calculates the average time taken.
